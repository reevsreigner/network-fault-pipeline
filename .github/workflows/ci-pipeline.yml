# This is a basic CI (Continuous Integration) workflow for a Python project.
name: Run Python Tests

# Controls when the workflow will run.
# It triggers on every push or pull request to the 'main' branch.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
jobs:
  # This job is named 'build'
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up a Python environment on the runner
      - name: Set up Python 3.12
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"

      # Step 3: Installs project dependencies from requirements.txt
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      # Step 4: Runs pytest to execute the unit tests
      - name: Run tests with pytest
        run: |
          python -m pytest
